# Snake, Water, Gun - Python Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake, Water, Gun" game, similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors. It demonstrates basic control structures, user input handling, and conditional logic in Python.

## Game Rules

- Snake beats Water
- Water beats Gun
- Gun beats Snake
- If both choices are the same, it's a draw

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3 recommended).
2. Enter one of the following options when prompted:
   - `s` for Snake
   - `w` for Water
   - `g` for Gun
3. The computer will randomly select its move.
4. The outcome will be printed based on the game logic.

## Files

- `snake_water_gun_basic.py`  
  Contains the initial version using basic `if-elif` statements for decision logic.

- `snake_water_gun_optimized.py`  
  A cleaner version using arithmetic logic to determine the winner.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
python snake_water_gun_basic.py
# or
python snake_water_gun_optimized.py
